gemstash-setup - Customize your Gemstash configuration interactively

Synopsis
========

`gemstash setup [--redo] [--debug] [--config-file FILE]`

Description
===========

Customize your Gemstash configuration interactively. This will save your config file, but only if a few checks pass after you've provided your answers.

Usage
-----

    gemstash setup
    gemstash setup --redo
    gemstash setup --config-file <file>

Options
=======

-   `--redo`: Redo the configuration. This does nothing the first time `gemstash setup` is run. If you want to change your configuration using `gemstash setup` after you've run it before, you must provide this option, otherwise Gemstash will simply indicate your setup is complete.

-   `--debug`: Output additional information if one of the checks at the end of setup fails. This will do nothing if all checks pass.

-   `--config-file FILE`: Specify the config file to write to. Without this option, your configuration will be written to `~/.gemstash/config.yml`. If you write to a custom location, you will need to pass the `--config-file` option to all Gemstash commands.
